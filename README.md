# space-carrier

Imported from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/spacecarrier/).

Uses the Open Internal War's engine (improved). Will try to feature dynamic space battles with modules handling.

See Gratuitious Space Battles for what the concept could have given if I had the time and skill necessary in my high school years (~2012).
